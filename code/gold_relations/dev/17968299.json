  "title": "Analysis of -1082 IL-10 gene polymorphism in Iranian patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis.",
  "body": "BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease and its severe forms, such as aggressive periodontitis, are suggested to have a genetic basis. Among the genetic factors, polymorphisms in cytokine genes have recently been described in susceptibility to periodontitis. IL-10 is a multi-functional cytokine thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. A substitution G/A polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene at position -1082 has been associated with different amounts of IL-10 production. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible links between -1082(G/A) polymorphism of the IL-10 gene and the generalized form of aggressive periodontitis. MATERIAL/METHODS: This study included 52 Iranian Khorasanian (north-east province of Iran) subjects suffering from generalized aggressive periodontitis referred to the Periodontology Department of Mashhad Dental School. They were compared to 61 age and sex-matched healthy controls of the same race. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood cells and genotyping was performed by means of the amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method. Data were analyzed using the chi-squared test. RESULTS: There was no marked difference in genotype frequencies between the controls and generalized aggressive periodontitis patients (p=0.585). Moreover, no association between patients and normal subjects was found in their allele frequency (p=0.329). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the polymorphic nucleotide A at position -1082 of the IL-10 gene is not associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis in the Iranian population.",
