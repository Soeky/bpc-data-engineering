A family with two consecutive nonsense mutations in BMPR1A causing juvenile polyposis.

We describe a novel germline mutation of BMPR1A in a family with juvenile polyposis and colon cancer. This mutation consists of two consecutive substitutions (735-6 TG>AT) that cause two nonsense mutations (Y245X, G246X), inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, on one parental chromosome. This mutation caused protein truncation, and represents a novel case of consecutive nonsense mutations in human disease.
