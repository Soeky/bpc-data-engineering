HEB is required for the specification of fetal IL-17-producing gd T cells.

IL-17-producing gd T (gdT17) cells are critical components of the innate immune system. However, the gene networks that control their development are unclear. Here we show that HEB (HeLa E-box binding protein, encoded by Tcf12) is required for the generation of a newly defined subset of fetal-derived CD73- gdT17 cells. HEB is required in immature CD24+CD73- gd T cells for the expression of Sox4, Sox13, and Rorc, and these genes are repressed by acute expression of the HEB antagonist Id3. HEB-deficiency also affects mature CD73+ gd T cells, which are defective in RORgt expression and IL-17 production. Additionally, the fetal TCRg chain repertoire is altered, and peripheral Vg4 gd T cells are mostly restricted to the IFNg-producing phenotype in HEB-deficient mice. Therefore, our work identifies HEB-dependent pathways for the development of CD73+ and CD73- gdT17 cells, and provides mechanistic evidence for control of the gdT17 gene network by HEB.
