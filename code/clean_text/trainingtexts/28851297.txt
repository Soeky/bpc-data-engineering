An Ag-globin G->A gene polymorphism associated with b(0)39 thalassemia globin gene and high fetal hemoglobin production.

BACKGROUND: Increase of the expression of g-globin gene and high production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in b-thalassemia patients is widely accepted as associated with a milder or even asymptomatic disease. The search for HbF-associated polymorphisms (such as the XmnI, BCL11A and MYB polymorphisms) has recently gained great attention, in order to stratify b-thalassemia patients with respect to expectancy of the first transfusion, need for annual intake of blood, response to HbF inducers (the most studied of which is hydroxyurea). METHODS: Ag-globin gene sequencing was performed on genomic DNA isolated from a total of 75 b-thalassemia patients, including 31 b(0)39/b(0)39, 33 b(0)39/b(+)IVSI-110, 9 b(+)IVSI-110/b(+)IVSI-110, one b(0)IVSI-1/b(+)IVSI-6 and one b(0)39/b(+)IVSI-6. RESULTS: The results show that the rs368698783 polymorphism is present in b-thalassemia patients in the 5'UTR sequence (+25) of the Ag-globin gene, known to affect the LYAR (human homologue of mouse Ly-1 antibody reactive clone) binding site 5'-GGTTAT-3'. This Ag(+25 G->A) polymorphism is associated with the Gg-globin-XmnI polymorphism and both are linked with the b(0)39-globin gene, but not with the b(+)IVSI-110-globin gene. In agreement with the expectation that this mutation alters the LYAR binding activity, we found that the Ag(+25 G->A) and Gg-globin-XmnI polymorphisms are associated with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells isolated from b(0)39/b(0)39 thalassemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: As a potential explanation of our findings, we hypothesize that in b-thalassemia the Gg-globin-XmnI/Ag-globin-(G->A) genotype is frequently under genetic linkage with b(0)-thalassemia mutations, but not with the b(+)-thalassemia mutation here studied (i.e. b(+)IVSI-110) and that this genetic combination has been selected within the population of b(0)-thalassemia patients, due to functional association with high HbF. Here we describe the characterization of the rs368698783 (+25 G->A) polymorphism of the Ag-globin gene associated in b(0)39 thalassemia patients with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells.
